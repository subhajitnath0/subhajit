Dustbin is a container which collects garbageâ€™s or stores items which recyclable or non-recyclable, decompose and non-decompose. They are usually used in homes, office etc, but in case they are full no one is there to clean it and the garbage are spilled out. The surrounding of a dustbin is also conducive for increasing the pollution level. Air pollution due to a dustbin can produce bacteria and virus which can produce life harmful diseases for human. Therefore, we have designed a smart dustbin using ARDUINO UNO, ultrasonic sensor which will sense the item to be thrown in the dustbin and open the lid with the help of the motor. It is an IOT based project that will bring a new and smart way of cleanliness. It is a decent gadget to make your home clean, due to practically all offspring of home consistently make it grimy and spread litter to a great extent by electronics, rappers and various other things. Since the smart dustbin is additionally intriguing and children make fun with it so it will help to maintain cleanliness in home. It will be applied for various type of waste. Dustbin will open its lid when someone/object is near at some range then it will wait for given time period than it will close automatically`);
